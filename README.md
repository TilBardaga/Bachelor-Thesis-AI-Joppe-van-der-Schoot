README:

In the main_program() there is the code which activates the main data gathering code (new_gather_data).
Some things are commented out as well, which are tests which were run for testing purposes.

If you want to run the simulations with replacing the None values, then this can be done in lie_detection function
in the agent.py class.
There you can set the boolean fill_in_nones to either True or False, depending on what you want to run.
